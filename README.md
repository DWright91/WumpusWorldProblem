# WumpusWorldProblem

Problem: Use the resolution theorem to prove that there is no pit in location (2, 2) in the Wumpus world example. Construct the knowledge-base based on the locations that the agent has visited, i.e., locations (1, 1), (2,1), and (1, 2). 

See the figure below. Is the KB sufficient to prove there is no pit in location (2, 2)?
